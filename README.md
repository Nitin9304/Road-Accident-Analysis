The road accidents analysis involves a comprehensive examination of traffic-related incidents, encompassing a thorough investigation into contributing factors, such as driver behavior, road conditions, and vehicle-related issues. This analysis incorporates statistical data, accident reports, and relevant variables to identify patterns, trends, and potential risk factors associated with road accidents. The goal is to glean insights that can inform safety measures, policy development, and interventions aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of road accidents, ultimately enhancing road safety for all stakeholders.
